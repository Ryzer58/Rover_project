Hardware Notes:
SBC - Raspberry Pi or similar with GPIO capabilities
Arduino microcontroller - designed around the uno but will later shift to a nano or Adafruit feather
Generic DC motor (possibly replace with brushless in future)
Tower Pro Mg995 Servo
2 * Buck converters (Supply for the SBC and another for the motors)
Velleman motor shield (only requires 2 pins per motor)
Uart connection between SBC and Arduino - for 3v Arduino boards it is possible to use a direct wired connection instead of USB.
3D printed Chasis
